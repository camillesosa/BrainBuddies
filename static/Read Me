How to run the website without running into problems with PHP support:

1) Download XAMPP (or any php service)
2) Go to system settings > search enviroment variables
3) At the bottom go to ...Enviroment Variables
4) Click 'Path' in the second bottom window under System
5) Click Add
6) Put the path to E:\XAMPP\php
7) Test going into powershell by doing php -v (if you see the version, it's working)
8) In powershell, cd to the folder which contains the BrainBuddies files
9) Type in powershell: php -S localhost:8000
10) Then in your browser run localhost:8000/home.html

Note: Make sure you are running the local sql db as well, or you'll encounter error pages (I use MAMP)

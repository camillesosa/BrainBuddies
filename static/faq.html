    <h3 style="color: black">What will BrainBuddies be available on?</h3>
    <h3>At the outset, BrainBuddies will only be operating through a website with the initial process of creating an account being at a BrainBuddies location. This process will be assisted by a member of BrainBuddies’ staff, using our technology to capture your brain waves.</h3>
    <h3 style="color: black">What is the process of BrainBuddies and how are matches created?</h3>
    <h3>Matches will be created by comparing users’ brain waves after watching specific videos. An initial form will be completed to select an appropriate video and your brain waves are captured while watching said video. After this, a similarity value will be calculated between different users, which will determine the matches.</h3>
    <h3 style="color: black">How is information gathered from the brain?</h3>
    <h3>A device is placed on your head, similar to that of a headband, that has sensors along the inside of it! These sensors are able to collect data from your brain to essentially be read as brainwaves in reaction to what you're watching in the videos!</h3>
    <h3 style="color: black">What kind of videos will be featured on BrainBuddies?</h3>
    <h3>The videos that are selected are tied to the hobbies that users select during the initial form. The way you react to these hobbies will match you with other users that have similar hobbies!</h3>
    <h3 style="color: black">Is personal information protected?</h3>
    <h3>No personal information is shared between members without the permission of the user. Additionally, no personal information is being gathered that users will be unaware of.</h3>
